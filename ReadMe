Every year, millions of Swiss Francs are wasted in the Real Estate market. Renovations are happening too early because they are based on statistical average lifespans and not actual evaluations done together with experts. This is where our product, House Evil AI, comes in. 

Just by uploading a few images and a general description of the property, we get an accurate assessment powered by Apertus and AI Vision. 

The report starts by highlighting spot damages and also categorizing each image. Also, the general report is given with detailed analysis. But it gets really interesting when we go to the interactive cost breakdown section. Each category has its own renovation suggestions, giving you information about when to renovate, what to renovate and how much it will cost. Then further information is also given and also the location is visualized. 

Our product fulfills the objective of actually providing potential homeowners and investors with sufficient information and the perfect renovation timing, saving everyone money and also improving sustainability in the real estate market.
