# Housing Problem Detection System

This system analyzes photos of house rooms, detects problems, and marks them with red circles at their pixel coordinates.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Problem Detection**: Uses Google's Gemini AI to identify issues like cracks, water damage, mold, etc.
- **Visual Problem Marking**: Draws red circles on detected problems with numbered labels
- **Coordinate Output**: Provides exact (x, y) pixel coordinates of detected problems
- **Simple Command Line Interface**: Easy to use with any house room photo

## Setup

1. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Get a Google AI API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```
   GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

### Simple Version (PIL only)
```bash
python simple_problem_detector.py photos/photo1-balcony.jpg
```

### Full Version (with OpenCV)
```bash
python problem_detector.py photos/photo1-balcony.jpg
```

### With Custom Output Path
```bash
python simple_problem_detector.py photos/photo1-balcony.jpg output/marked_photo.jpg
```

### AI Highlighting Based on CSV Findings
```bash
python nano_edit.py problems_photo1-balcony.jpg.csv --output-dir highlighted
```

Use this workflow after running `real_estate_problem_analyzer.py`. It reads the generated CSV,
groups issues per image, and asks Google Imagen to return a version of the photo where each
problem is highlighted with a translucent overlay and numbered label. Flags of interest:

- `--dry-run` prints the prompts without calling the API (no quota usage).
- `--overwrite` forces regeneration if the destination file already exists.
- `--model` selects an alternate Imagen edit model if your account has access.

## Output

The script will:
1. Analyze the input image for problems
2. Print detected problems with their coordinates
3. Create a new image with red circles marking problem locations
4. Save the marked image with a descriptive filename

Example output:
```
Analyzing image: photos/photo1-balcony.jpg
Found 2 problem(s):
  1. Water stain on ceiling at (450, 200)
  2. Crack in wall at (300, 400)
Marked image saved as: photo1-balcony_problems_detected.jpg

Success! Analysis complete.
Original image: photos/photo1-balcony.jpg
Marked image: photo1-balcony_problems_detected.jpg
Problems found: 2
```

An AI-powered image analysis tool that uses Google's Gemini Vision model to analyze photos and provide detailed descriptions of what's visible inside them. Perfect for housing inspections, property analysis, or any scenario where you need comprehensive visual understanding.

## Features ✨

- 🤖 **Advanced AI Vision**: Powered by Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash multi-modal model
- 📸 **Multiple Image Formats**: Supports JPEG, PNG, WebP, and other common formats
- 🎯 **Detailed Analysis**: Provides comprehensive descriptions including objects, colors, lighting, and spatial relationships
- 💬 **Custom Prompts**: Use custom prompts for specific analysis needs
- 🛡️ **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures and invalid inputs
- 🖥️ **User-Friendly CLI**: Simple command-line interface with helpful examples

## Quick Start 🚀

### 1. Installation

First, make sure you have conda activated, then install the required packages:

```bash
# Install required packages
conda install -c conda-forge google-generativeai pillow python-dotenv

# Or using pip with requirements file
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Get Google AI API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key
3. Copy the API key

### 3. Configure API Key

Create a `.env` file in the project directory:

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` and add your API key:

```
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 4. Run Analysis

```bash
# Basic analysis
python process-image.py path/to/your/image.jpg

# With custom prompt
python process-image.py image.jpg --prompt "What safety issues do you see in this room?"

# With verbose logging
python process-image.py image.jpg --verbose

# Provide API key directly (alternative to .env file)
python process-image.py image.jpg --api-key your_api_key_here
```

## Usage Examples 📝

### Basic Image Analysis
```bash
python process-image.py house_interior.jpg
```

### Housing Inspection Analysis
```bash
python process-image.py kitchen.jpg --prompt "Analyze this kitchen for potential safety issues, cleanliness, and maintenance needs"
```

### Property Features Analysis
```bash
python process-image.py living_room.jpg --prompt "Describe the style, condition, and notable features of this living space"
```

### Custom Analysis
```bash
python process-image.py exterior.jpg --prompt "What architectural features and landscaping elements do you notice?"
```

## Command Line Options 🔧

```
positional arguments:
  image_path            Path to the image file to analyze

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --prompt PROMPT, -p PROMPT
                        Custom prompt for image analysis
  --api-key API_KEY, -k API_KEY
                        Google AI API key (can also be set via GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY env variable)

```

## API Usage 🔌

You can also use the `ImageAnalyzer` class programmatically:

```python
from process_image import ImageAnalyzer

# Initialize analyzer
analyzer = ImageAnalyzer()

# Basic analysis
result = analyzer.analyze_image("path/to/image.jpg")
print(result)

# Custom analysis
custom_result = analyzer.analyze_with_custom_prompt(
    "path/to/image.jpg", 
    "What furniture and decorations do you see?"
)
print(custom_result)
```

## Troubleshooting 🔧

### Common Issues

**Import Error for google-generativeai:**
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge google-generativeai
# or
pip install google-generativeai
```

**API Key Not Found:**
- Ensure your `.env` file exists and contains `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY`
- Or pass the API key directly with `--api-key`

**Image Loading Error:**
- Check that the image file exists and is readable
- Ensure the image format is supported
- Try converting the image to a standard format (JPEG/PNG)

**Network/API Errors:**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify your API key is valid and has quota remaining
- Try again later if there are temporary service issues
